Hello Welcome!!!
I am thrilled to share my second project in front end development as a beginer.
I have build a Todo list, that makes life easier by adding important tasks in it, and make sure to complete them.

How my implementation in javascript?
   I have set of functions that runs my Todo list perfect, they are,
      1) MakeVisibleTheTask(){}:
         This function will get the added task object data and creating an li tag for that any particular task and append that li tag 
      in the HTML file.
      2)renderList(){}:
         This functions works like a refreshing a page after adding or removing taks, whenever we adding or removing tasks the whole list 
      will be render again in order to get the current list. 
      3)removeTask(){}:
         This function takes an argument of task id of particular task and remove that task from the list.
      4)addTask(){}:
         This function takes an input of task name, and creating an object data of taks consists task name, task id and status of the 
      task 
      true or false.
      5)notfications(){}:
         This function helps us by makes an alert on adding a task or removing a task.
      6)handleInputKeyPress(){}:
         This function for handle the keypresses
      7)handleClicks(){}:
         This function for handle the mouse clicks
