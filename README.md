<p>Hello Welcome!!!</p>
<p>I am thrilled to share my second project in front end development as a beginer.</p>
<p>I have build a Todo list, that makes life easier by adding important tasks in it, and make sure to complete them.</p>

<p>How my implementation in javascript?</p>
<p>I have set of functions that runs my Todo list perfect, they are,</p>
<h4>1) MakeVisibleTheTask(){}:</h4>
<p>This function will get the added task object data and creating an li tag for that any particular task and append that li tag in the HTML file.</p>
<h4>2)renderList(){}:</h4>
 <p>This functions works like a refreshing a page after adding or removing taks, whenever we adding or removing tasks the whole list will be render again in order to get the current list. </p>
<h4>3)removeTask(){}:</h4>
<p>This function takes an argument of task id of particular task and remove that task from the list.</p>
<h4>addTask(){}:</h4>
<p>This function takes an input of task name, and creating an object data of taks consists task name, task id and status of the task true or false.</p>
<h4>5)notfications(){}:</h4>
<p>This function helps us by makes an alert on adding a task or removing a task.</p>
<h4>6)handleInputKeyPress(){}:</h4>
<p>This function for handle the keypresses</p>
<h4>7)handleClicks(){}:</h4>
<p>This function for handle the mouse clicks</p>
